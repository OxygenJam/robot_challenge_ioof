# IOOF Holdings Robot Challenge
---
This is a coding challenge based from the following [repository](https://github.com/ioof-holdings/recruitment/wiki/Robot-Challenge.). 
This will be my implementation and solution to the challenge.
The implmentation has also taken into account the extension of the problem wherein there can be
multiple robots placed in the table.

This has been written under Javascript under the NodeJS environment, as such NodeJS is required to run the application.
Main application to run the program will be **app.js**
